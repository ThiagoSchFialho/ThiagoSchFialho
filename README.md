ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ThiagoSchFialho

I'm looking for learn more about coding, web development and things like this.

but what I'm really interested in is coding in python, java, php and javascript.

I've been working on a project recently with python and mysql for a car parking system.

And I am thinking about a site that provides you in a personal place to write about every thing you want (like a diary).
  It will be completely customizable to give to you a comfortable time with you and only you.
  With a music player, cusotmizable colors, background, fonts...
